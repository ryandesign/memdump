# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on ideas from [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Common
Changelog](https://common-changelog.org/). Because of limitations imposed on the
format of version numbers by the Macintosh `vers` resource, this project does
not currently use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.0d3] - 2025-05-22

_What's in a name?_

### Changed

- **UI**: The selected range of addresses is included in the default filename.
  ([#7](https://github.com/ryandesign/memdump/issues/7))
- **UI**: Start and End + 1 labels have been replaced by First and Last, and the
  last address now represents the last memory address that will be dumped, not
  one past the end. ([#8](https://github.com/ryandesign/memdump/issues/8))
- **UI**: Addresses are now shown in hexadecimal by default instead of decimal.
